This assignment will give you hands-on practice in working with a realistic data warehouse.

Objectives

‚Ä¢ Create a connection to the Adventureworks Data Warehouse (‚Äúaw‚Äù) on a shared server

‚Ä¢ Examine the Adventureworks Data Warehouse to become familiar with the structure and contents of a realistic star schema data warehouse

‚Ä¢ Using a SQL query editor (such as MySQL Workbench)

1. Study the database and answer questions about its contents and structure

2. Create and run queries against the warehouse to answer questions about the structure and contents of the data warehouse

3. Create and run queries against the warehouse to analyze Adventureworks‚Äô business.

Submission Requirements:

2. Where the question requires SQL, submit both your SQL code and your answer set.

3. Where the question requires a written answer, please submit proper sentences explaining your answer to the question.

NOTES:

Assignment Problems:

NOTE: This is a Linux server and Linux commands are typically case sensitive. If you attempt a query and it looks right but doesn‚Äôt work, be sure that the case used in naming database objects in your SQL exactly matches object names on the server.

NOTE: Be sure to read ‚ÄúHints regarding the data‚Äù in Appendix A of this document prior to attempting to answer these questions.

1. Understanding the information_schema

1.1 Use the information_schema to find out how many rows there are in each table in the adventureworks data warehouse. Show the table name and its row count.

Hints:

‚Ä¢ use information_schema;

‚Ä¢ There is a table within information_schema called TABLES.

1.2 Then run a SELECT COUNT(*) against each table and compare the row count from the SELECT COUNT(*) to the result from the information_schema.

1.3 Do some research to find out why MySQL might return different values in such a scenario. Document your findings. In other words, explain WHY is the row count from the information_schema might sometimes be different from the SELECT

COUNT(*).

1.4 Why is the select against the information_schema more efficient (although perhaps less accurate) than the SELECT COUNT(*)?

Hints:

‚Ä¢ This AW schema was created using the ‚Äúinnodb‚Äù database engine.

2. Use the information_schema to list out each table in the adventureworks data warehouse and its primary key.

Hints:

‚Ä¢ There is a table within information_schema called COLUMNS.

‚Ä¢ Look for a column called column_key

3. What standard table naming convention did the AdventureWorksDW database designers use to differentiate dimension tables from fact tables in this star schema data warehouse?

4. What is the purpose of the recursive relationship on DimEmployee?

5. What are the three types of models of bikes sold by AdventureWorks? Provide your SQL query, and your answer set along with your answer to the question. (HINT: There are many models, but all those models fall into just three major types of bikes.)

6. Of these three, which type of bike model had the lowest sales (in dollar volume) in 2004? Provide your SQL query, and your answer set along with your answer to the question.

7. List six of the other non-bike products sold by AdventureWorks. (Pick any six.) Provide your SQL query, and your answer set along with your answer to the question.

8. Compare and rank the total counts of the bikes sold by AdventureWorks for each of the years 2001 ‚Äì 2004 by color. What was the most popular color of bikes sold in each of these 4 years? Provide your SQL query, and your answer set along with your answer to the question. You can assume that one row in the fact table equals one sale.

HINT: Since the fact table contains sales for all kinds of products, you should include only fact rows where the sale is for a bike. One easy way to do this is a WHERE clause selecting only rows where EnglishProductSubcategoryName contains the string ‚Äúbikes‚Äù. There are other ways to determine this as well.

9. List and compare the total sales quantities (number of bikes, NOT dollars) of bikes sold (all model types) by customer gender by year and month. In which year and month were bike sales to females the highest? Provide your SQL query, and your answer set along with your answer to the question.

10. For the year 2004, which State/Province yielded the highest margin for AdventureWorks?

(HINT: use the customer‚Äôs State/Province.) Provide your SQL query, and your answer set along with your answer to the question.

Appendix A ‚Äì Background on the Company:

The AdventureWorks data warehouse is based on a fictitious bicycle manufacturing company named Adventure Works Cycles. Microsoft created this company and its databases (an OLTP database and a Star Schema Data warehouse) to assist people in learning about database technologies.

Adventure Works produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to North American, European, and Asian commercial and consumer markets. The base of operations is located in Bothell, Washington with about 500 employees, and several regional sales teams are located throughout their market base.

Adventure Works sells products wholesale to specialty shops and to individuals through the

Internet. For the data warehouse exercises, you will work with the AdventureWorksDW Internet sales tables, which contain realistic patterns that work well for data warehousing exercises.

The Internet Sales star schema contains a fact table with data regarding customer purchases of bicycles via the web.

The Internet Sales star schema contains information on several thousand customers. These customers live in several countries, which are combined into three regions:

‚Ä¢ North America (83%)

‚Ä¢ Europe (12%)

‚Ä¢ Australia (7%)

The database contains sales data covering several fiscal years.

The products in the database are broken down by subcategory, model, and product.

AdventureWorks does business in multiple countries, so some attributes in the data warehouse contain descriptions in multiple languages.

In 2000, Adventure Works Cycles bought a small manufacturing plant, Importadores Neptuno, located in Mexico. Importadores Neptuno manufactures several critical subcomponents for the Adventure Works Cycles product line. These subcomponents are shipped to the Bothell location for final product assembly. In 2001, Importadores Neptuno, became the sole manufacturer and distributor of the touring bicycle product group.

Coming off a successful fiscal year, Adventure Works Cycles is looking to broaden its market share by targeting their sales to their best customers, extending their product availability through an external Web site, and reducing their cost of sales through lower production costs.

As a bicycle manufacturing company, Adventure Works Cycles has the following four product lines:

‚Ä¢ Bicycles that are manufactured at the Adventure Works Cycles company.

‚Ä¢ Bicycle components that are replacement parts, such as wheels, pedals, or brake assemblies.

‚Ä¢ Bicycle apparel that is purchased from vendors for resale to Adventure Works Cycles customers.

‚Ä¢ Bicycle accessories that are purchased from vendors for resale to Adventure Works Cycles customers.

At Adventure Works Cycles, the purchasing department buys raw materials and parts used in the manufacture of Adventure Works Cycles bicycles. Adventure Works Cycles also purchases products for resale, such as bicycle apparel and bicycle add-ons like water bottles and pumps.

The AdventureWorks Data Warehouse is updated by an ETL process that periodically pulls data from the OLTP database and loads it into the data warehouse.

Hints regarding the data:

Granularity: A row in the FactInternetSales table represents the sale of one item by

AdventureWorks. The item sold might be a bike, an article of clothing, a biking accessory (like a helmet), or a repair/replacement part for a bike. For this exercise, we will only look at bike sales.

The column ProductStandardCost holds the dollar amount that it cost AdventureWorks to build or obtain a bike. UnitPrice minus ProductStandardCost represents how much profit or margin AdventureWorks made on the sale.

DimProductSubcategory.EnglishProductSubcategoryName contains a description that identifies which type of item was sold. This columns holds a grouping of model types.

DimProduct.ModelName and DimProduct.EnglishProductName further identify more detailed product/model information regarding the item sold. DimProduct.ModelName holds the specific model of bike sold.

Appendix B ‚Äì Creating your connection to the aw data warehouse

To complete this assignment, you must connect your MySQL Workbench (or query editor of your choice) on your PC to an instance of MySQL running on a VM within the CU Boulder Computer Science department. The server name is elra-sql.

STEP ONE: Connect to the CU VPN (Virtual Private Network)

If you already have the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client on your PC, just launch it and go to STEP TWO.

If you DO NOT already have the Cisco VPN client on your PC, then go to this link, download the right Cisco VPN client, install it, and launch it.

https://oit.colorado.edu/services/network-internet-services/vpn

When you launch the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client you will see this:

Then click on ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù. Then you will see this. Login to the VPN with your Identikey credentials.

If you have any trouble connecting to the VPN, call the OIT help desk.

STEP TWO: Connect to the MySQL Server

First, you will connect to the server using the SSH protocol using your normal CU identikey credentials. Then while connected to that server, secondly you will establish a connection to the instance of MySQL running on that server.

Prerequisites:

SSH Hostname: elra-sql.cs.colorado.edu

SSH Username: your CU Identikey username (ex. niri0478)

SSH Password: your CU Identikey password

MySQL Username: your CU Identikey username (ex. niri0478)

MySQL Password: ‚Äúpassword‚Äù

Step 2.1:

This is the first screen you will see when you open MySQL Workbench. Navigate to the upper left corner and click on ‚Äú+‚Äù icon to create a new connection.

Step 2.2:

The setup new connection dialog window will pop up.

First, give your new connection a name, like ‚ÄúAW‚Äù or ‚ÄúHW4‚Äù or whatever you like.

Then navigate to the dropdown menu titled ‚ÄúConnection Method‚Äù and select Standard TCP/IP over SSH.

Step 2.3:

Fill in the SSH Hostname as elra-sql.cs.colorado.edu and enter your identikey as your SSH Username.

Then click the button labeled ‚ÄúStore in Keychain‚Äù for SSH Password and type in your identikey password when prompted.

Step 2.4

Leave the first two fields in the red box as is. Then enter your MySQL login credentials:

Enter your CU Identikey name in the username. Then, select ‚ÄúStore in Keychain‚Äù if this option appears, and when prompted, type in the password ‚Äúpassword‚Äù.

Step 2.5

Test the connection by clicking ‚ÄúTest Connection‚Äù. If you have followed the steps correctly the window shown above will appear. (NOTE: I connect as ROOT since I own the database. You connect as yourself (identified by your identikey with the password ‚Äúpassword‚Äù.)

If you get a message about the server‚Äôs fingerprint, just click continue.

Once the success window appears, click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù on the popup window, then ‚Äúclose‚Äù on the configuration window.

Step 6:

Your list of connections will now display the new one you just created.

Click on the new connection to launch a MySQL Workbench query editor session against your connection to the ‚Äúaw‚Äù instance of MySQL on elra-sql.
